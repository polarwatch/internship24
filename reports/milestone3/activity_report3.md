## Introduction
This activity report summarizes the tasks I completed for milestone 3 of my Satellite Data Scientist internship at NOAA PolarWatch.

## Activities Completed

### Activity 1: Climatology Tutorial
I completed a tutorial titled ["Python for Climate Data Analysis: A Tutorial + Code"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-climate-data-analysis-tutorial-code-ali-ahmadalipour/) by Ali Ahmadalipour, a research scientist at Google. The tutorial provided an in-depth introduction to geospatial and climate data analysis using Python. It covered daily gridded observation data, monthly climate forecast data, and climate change projection data, while also familiarizing me with key terminology and characteristics of geospatial data such as spatial resolution, temporal resolution, lead time, anomalies, and ensemble members.

### Activity 2: Sea Ice Concentration Data Analysis
Building on the skills I learned from the tutorial, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of sea ice concentration data for 2023, compared to the historical climatology period (2006-2020). This analysis included calculating weekly climatology, comparing 2023 sea ice concentration values against climatology, identifying anomalies, analyzing trends using the Mann-Kendall test, performing statistical significance testing, and mapping anomalies.

### Activity 3: Presentation to PolarWatch Team
I created a presentation to summarize and present the findings from my sea ice concentration analysis to the PolarWatch team. The presentation highlighted key trends, anomalies, and statistically significant differences identified in the 2023 sea ice concentration data.

### Conclusion
During milestone 3, I deepened my understanding of climatology and geospatial data analysis, applied these skills to analyze sea ice concentration data, and effectively communicated my findings to the PolarWatch team.
