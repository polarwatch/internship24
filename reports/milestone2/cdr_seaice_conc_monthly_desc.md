## Overview
The **Sea Ice Concentration, NOAA/NSIDC Climate Data Record V4, Northern Hemisphere, 25km, Science Quality, 1978-Present, Monthly** dataset provides science-quality, monthly records of sea ice concentration (SIC) across the Northern Hemisphere. This dataset is a Climate Data Record (CDR) created from passive microwave satellite data. The SIC values are generated using a rule-based approach that combines results from 2 algorithms: the NASA Team (NT) algorithm (Cavalieri et al. 1984) and the NASA Bootstrap (BT) algorithm (Comiso 1986). This dataset is essential for analyzing long-term trends and variability in SIC.


## Key Features
- **Temporal Coverage:** November 1, 1978 to December 1, 2023
- **Composites:** Monthly
- **Spatial Coverage:** Arctic
- **Spatial Resolution:** 25 km x 25 km
- **Projection:** NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North, EPSG:3411
- **Data Format:** NetCDF, CSV, graphics, and more

## Data Source
The dataset is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The data is derived from passive microwave satellite sensors.

## Variables
- **Sea Ice Concentration**: The percentage of ocean area covered by sea ice, reported as the fraction (0 to 1) of each grid cell that is covered by ice.

## Access
- The dataset is available for download through the PolarWatch ERDDAP platform and the NSIDC website.
