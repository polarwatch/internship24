## Objective
Sea ice retreat in the polar region is expected to increase emissions of sea salt aerosols (SSA) and biogenic gases, impacting the climate by increasing the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) population and altering solar radiation. This study measured aerosol compositions at high time resolution (1 hour) in polynya regions of the Southern Ocean (SO) to assess the effects of sea ice concentrations on SSA and secondary biogenic aerosol (SBA). Marine aerosols significantly influence the global energy budget by absorbing and scattering solar radiation and acting as CCN. This study builds on previous research on sea spray aerosols, such as SSA, which are produced from bubble-bursting processes and contribute to aerosol light scattering in the marine boundary layer. The study also examines marine secondary aerosols, derived from biogenic sulfur cycles and organic compounds, with a focus on dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emissions. High sea ice concentrations reduce heat, momentum, and gas exchanges between air and sea, but as sea ice melts, more sea salt particles and DMS are released, potentially doubling SSA populations in the Arctic by 2100.

## Methods
- **Data Collection**: Aerosol compositions were measured at high time resolution (1 hour) using an in-situ gas and aerosol composition monitoring system in polynya regions of the Southern Ocean.
- **Analysis**: The study analyzed variations in aerosol chemical compositions in different sea ice concentration regions of the Ross Sea, Antarctica, and characterized impact factors on marine aerosol emissions.

## Results and Discussion
- **Key Findings**: 
  - SSA emissions increased by more than 30% as sea ice concentration decreased from 85% to 29%.
  - The highest SSA concentration occurred in drifting sea ice regions.
  - Sea ice melting increased SBA concentrations by enhancing air-sea exchanges of SBA precursor gases and releasing algae from sea ice.
  - Positive correlations were found between SSA and wind speed, while SBA showed no clear correlation with wind speed.
  - Different regions showed varying impacts of wind speed on SSA emissions, with higher slope values in the drifting sea ice and sea ice-free regions compared to the sea ice-covered regions.
- **Interpretation**: These findings suggest that sea ice retreat can significantly influence marine aerosol emissions, with potential implications for regional climate changes in polar areas.
- **Implications of Sea Ice Retreat**: 
  - The decrease in sea ice concentrations during spring and summer in the SO significantly increased the SSA burden in the atmosphere.
  - The enhancement of air DMS concentrations due to sea ice melting resulted in increased SBA concentrations.
  - The increase in SSA and SBA emissions with sea ice retreat is expected to enhance CCN populations, altering cloud properties and potentially cooling sea surface temperatures.
  - These changes could impact marine phytoplankton activity and further influence the production and release of DMS.

## Conclusion and Personal Reflection
- **Summary of Findings**: The study concludes that sea ice retreat in the SO can increase emissions of both SSA and SBA, with varying impacts depending on sea ice concentration and wind speed.
- **Implications**: The findings highlight the importance of understanding how sea ice retreat affects aerosol emissions and climate, particularly in light of global warming. The observation results extend knowledge regarding the effects of sea ice changes on marine aerosol emissions in polar regions and their potential climate impacts.
- **Relevance to Internship**: This article is highly relevant to my internship at NOAA PolarWatch, as it emphasizes the critical role of sea ice concentration data in studying climate impacts.
- **Key Takeaways**: I learned the importance of integrating SIC data with other measurements to analyze environmental changes. This understanding will aid in creating effective visualizations to support climate research.
