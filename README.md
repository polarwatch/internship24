## Milestone 2 (3 wks: 06.17 - 07.05) 

__Objective__ 
You will learn about one sea ice data from PolarWatch(sea ice concentration, thickness, IMS, etc.).

__Activities__
* Learn [Polarwatch catalog](https://polarwatch.noaa.gov/)
* Learn about how the data of your choice is developed
* Learn to [read metadata and describe the data product based on the metadata](https://github.com/polarwatch/code-gallery/tree/main/working-with-sea-ice-conc-data) 
* Literature review - find 3-5 journals on how the data are used in research or application and mentor/intern will select 1 article to read
* Create Python notebook to generate statistical summary and visualization of the data from PolarWatch

__Deliverables__
* Description of the data product
* Summary of the article
* Jupyter notebook with data summary and visualization
* Activity report (briefly describing what you have done)

__Note__
If Tien finds an interesting project and the internship schedule allows, we will try to incorporate modeling component.

## Milestone 3 (3 wks: 07.08 - 07.26)

__Objective__ 
You will learn to compute climatology and visulize data on a polar projected map.
Additional Activity: buidling predictive model using sea ice and machine learning

__Activities__
* Learn climatology of sea ice data
* Complete tutorials to [learn how to comptue climatology](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-climate-data-analysis-tutorial-code-ali-ahmadalipour/) [climatology](https://climate.usu.edu/people/yoshi/pyclm101/monthly.html#anomalies-and-climatology)
* Download data and compute climatology of your sea ice data
* Draft Jupyter notebook with explanation
* Draft a presentation and present data summary to the team


__Deliverables__

* Jupyter notebook
* Data summary report
* Activity report (briefly describing what you have done)


## Milestone 4a (2 wks: 07.29 - 08.09)

__Objective__
You will learn to model sea ice prediction using machine learning (deep learning) apporach. We will replicate the model introduced in the [paper] (https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climate-change-ai/papers/icml2021/50/paper.pdf)

  * Read journal article: https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climate-change-ai/papers/icml2021/50/paper.pdf
  * Create python notebook to build the predictive model using sea ice data from PolarWatch and LSTM algorithm
  * Git repo: https://github.com/big-data-lab-umbc/sea-ice-prediction/tree/main/climate-change-ai-workshop


## Milestone 4b (1 wks: 08.10 - 08.16)
